todo for talk (?? means optional, if time):

DONE stash the Kafeel chromatic fonts somewhere for easy copying in each time (can't be put in GitHub, not free fonts -  use .gitignore)

?? do another slide with the Multicolore fonts http://xerographer.github.io/multicoloure/ and Reinebow http://xerographer.github.io/reinebow/
plus the quote from the original multicolore designer

DONE 	Replace emojiparty with the EmojiOne examples
https://github.com/eosrei/emojione-color-font

TO-DO more font loading api examples, see https://drafts.csswg.org/css-font-loading/#font-load-event-examples

?? add font-kerning: normal to force all browsers to do the kerning they should be doing anyway

?? mentions same-origin policy and effect on webfonts

TO-DO DIAG add woff1 diagram, showing per-table compression, header, meta

TO-DO DIAG add woff2 diagram showing type rearrangement, discard, full stream compression 
add diag of hmtx, header & meta processing

TODO Brotli compression options for best decompress speed with slight size tradeoff
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10ZuRkawUDmeNKQCkmXrenCBva53NBKSwFzaBWEmn-8Y/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.gcafdb9c0a_0_194


TODO - second fallback font declare as urange all, actually has .notdef only. Use as server-side counter for when user content exceeds current subsetting.














=================
old todo 

NO TIME  slide with bad japanese serif latin, as example

Unicode range: start with syntax (say current slide content).
split definition format: top has pre code with Latin-only urange; 
bottom has dt descriptor dd allowed range of Unicode characters 
DONE

new slide with ampersand example DONE 
  but FF bug!! fixed but not deployed
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475891
in about:config, layout.css.unicode-range.enabled =  true
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range 
  live result works (with config change) so wtf

add slide with full css code
DONE

? make rochester into woff if cygwin stops misbehaving
copied as Amper.otf for faster live coding

DONE  finally, new slide with syntax apology if it still seems worth saying

DONE (but uses platform fonts not webfonts) replace second myriad pro with a different font that has condensed; pref a serif one

shift the h1 on OT features slide so it is over the green foundries not the grey ot features
DONE

add slide after #featureIntro with lots of features used at once. use megalopolis-extra, and spans to set the features (fancy ligatures, swashes)
DONE, could be improved with spans to set swashes from other stylistic sets

add the asian forms opentype feature example
  needs raw textarea with selectors
  use lang selector, simplified vs traditional chinese  草 (U+8349)
  Source Han Sans (Adobe) has CJK linguistic forms
  NOT DONE failed download after 1.4Gb, can't find equivalent fort with Han variant forms
  STILL NOT DONE problems using Source Han Sans with language-sensitive forms. 

STILL TO DO add equivalent low-level code using font-feature-settings

add font-synthesis: none
DONE but FF still synthesises a bold

add emoji and illuminated examples of chromatic fonts
DONE

Link to Adam Twardoch original proposal for SVG in OpenType, 2011
https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webfonts-wg/2011Jun/0112.html
and MS Build 2016 announcing support, 31 Mar 2016


DONE make woff1 and woff2 svg graphs for median filesize savings, data from woff2 evaluation report


(not yet) new slide in performance section: declaring subsetting with urange. multiple @font-face rules to make a composite font.
only downloaded if that range is needed
reduces page weight but can increase load time (more http requests, load on demand if text changes)


DONE font loading API if no time to make slides for it

 mention css4 font-palette property
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/
DONE

in futures, talk about new generic font families like emoji  and fangsong 
DONE


fix:
woff 1,0
sample with woff2 and woff1 fallback

-------
tips

each face needs its own @font-face. avoid synthetic bold and synthetic (obliqued) italic
